## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
I learned to use more efficiently the display property and to use more responsive measures. 
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to keep improving my use of css, to make it more efficient and cleaner. If you find any bugs or ways to improve my code, I would be very grateful with your feedback.
